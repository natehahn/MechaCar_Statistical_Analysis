# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

### Summary

The following documentation covers linear regression modeling for mpg, summary statistics of coil spring production lots, and finally using the t-test to sample different lots to determine whether they all fall within 1500psi.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

This is the result of running linear regression on the supplied spreadsheet of mpg data.  By looking at the data, we can immediate reject the null hypothesis and determine that there is a difference between mpg and the other variables, based on our p-value.  Of note, the variables with the most significnace of impacting miles per gallon are whether the vehicle has AWD, a spoiler, and the vehicle length.  The slope of the linear model is not zero due to the intercept having a negative correlation.  This type of model does provide an easy picture of MPG in relation to the provided variables.  By using this model you can easily identify where MPG can be gained or lost based on specific variables.
